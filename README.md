# REST API Automation Testing
Automated testing of gorest.co.in using RestAssured, testNG and cucumber

## Objective

Demonstrate use of the following testing technologies and procedures as part of providing a complete testing framework.

- RestAssured (REST API invocation and testing)
- TestNG (Assertions)
- Cucumber (BBD test case)
- Maven Multiple Modules 
- Generate JSON REST POJO content automatically using jsonschema2pojo-maven-plugin 
- Log4J2 (logging)

## gorest.co.in site tested
    [gorest web site] (https://gorest.co.in) is a "Online REST API for Testing and Prototyping". An account and a token must be generated to use this site but it is free to use.


## Module Definitions

###RestContent Module

    Creates POJO objects from json schema.  Json schema was generated by taking the REST API response and using [Liquid's schema generator](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-json-to-schema-converter)  to generate a json schema.
    POJO is then packaged as a jar and made a depencency of the RestTests module.
    Approach allows the POJO inputs for the REST APIs tested to be generated automatically.
    Ideally a json schema could be define to fully cover all POJO needs.
    Another option that would be more complete but require more work, would be to generaete the POJO using [jsonschema2pojo generator] (http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/).
    
###RestTests Module

    Contains all of the REST API tests utlizing RestAssured, TestNG and Cucumber.
